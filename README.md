## GENHK Car Price Prediction Assignment

This repository contains code and resources for a project aimed at predicting car prices using machine learning.

**Dataset:**

The project utilizes the "Car_Price.csv" dataset, which contains information about various car attributes and their corresponding prices.

**Goal:**

The primary objective is to build a predictive model that can accurately estimate the price of a car based on its features.

**Methodology:**

The project follows a typical machine learning workflow:

1. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing:**
   - Load and inspect the dataset using Pandas.
   - Clean the data by handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies, and transforming data types.
2. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Create new features from existing ones to improve model performance.
3. **Model Selection and Training:**
   - Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms for regression tasks.
   - Train the model on the prepared data.
4. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like R-squared, mean squared error, and others.
5. **Model Deployment (Optional):**
   - Deploy the trained model for real-time predictions.

**Code Structure:**

- `Car_Price(EDA+ML).ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook file containing initial code for data loading and inspection.

**Contributing:**

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests for improvements, new features, or bug fixes.
